SelWX Embedded Code
This is the code that runs on the ARM in the weather station.

Build requirements are GCC for arm-none-eabi and libopenstm32;
the easiest way to obtain both is via summon-arm-toolchain:
http://github.com/esden/summon-arm-toolchain

Edit it to set LIBOPENSTM32_EN=1 and run, then make sure its resulting
directory (~/arm-none-eabi by default) is in your PATH.

Build with 'make'; 'make upload' will run stm32loader.py to flash the
resulting binary onto the STM32 via its serial bootloader.
